# Welcome to my incomplete CONTRACT CLAIM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The Contract Claims Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of submitting, reviewing, and managing claims for lecturers. The system aims to reduce administrative overhead, ensure transparency, and improve the efficiency of claim processing.

Features
Lecturer Claims Submission:

Lecturers can submit claims for hours worked, including additional notes and supporting documentation.
Uploaded documents are securely stored and linked to each claim.
Review and Approval Workflow:

Claims are reviewed by program coordinators and academic managers.
Status updates (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected) are automated, ensuring lecturers are notified of progress.
Tracking Claims:

A dashboard provides a real-time overview of claim statuses.
Filters and sorting options allow users to manage claims efficiently.
Role-Based Access:

Lecturers: Submit and track claims.
Program Coordinators: Verify claims.
Academic Managers: Approve or reject claims.
Technical Details
Frontend: Razor views and Bootstrap for responsive and user-friendly interfaces.
Backend: ASP.NET Core MVC with Entity Framework Core for database interaction.
Database: SQL Server for storing claims and user data.
Current Challenges
Automating claim processing and data management is incomplete.
A Lecturer table could not be successfully added to the database, which affects user role differentiation.
Efforts to implement an HR Dashboard for claim oversight require further development.
